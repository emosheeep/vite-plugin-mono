Since we have no control over which page is opened, we set config base to '/' so that we can see the content when we enter the page. You can customize the vite config to reach whatever you want.

Click the link within the container's page and check the log from console for a development preview. Also you can open in a new tab for a further experience because it seems like the actual url won't sync with container's url immediately.

You can click '+' in the top right corner of the console to open an operable terminal, and then execute `yarn build` to build resource into `dist`.

# Locally Run

This example project works on pnpm's workspace protocol. If you wanna have a local experience with pnpm, you should cd into `'workspaces/plugin'` directory and **execute build command first**. But it doesn't matter if you work with yarn or npm.

Have a gooooood time!
